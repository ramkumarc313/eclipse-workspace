# Spring @MVC 3 cascading selects using jQuery


I'd be rich if I had a dollar for each time I heard someone ask "How do I
dynamically populate a drop down menu based on the current selection in another
drop down?" Actually that is probably the poster child usage of AJAX. You can
certainly use raw AJAX to accomplish this (just ask the Google). I want to
modify the question to "How do I do this using Spring @MVC 3?" So, this post
will present one way of doing this using the very popular JavaScript library
jQuery to accomplish the AJAX part

For the complete discussion, read the rest of my original [blog post](http://rockhoppertech.com/blog/spring-mvc-3-cascading-selects-using-jquery/).
